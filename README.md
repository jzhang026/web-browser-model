> ⚠️this tutorial require `node 10.x`, due to some constraint of low-level image render library.

1. install the packages

```
yarn install
```

2. start the http server first

```
yarn start:server
```

3. then run the client

```
yarn start:client
```

👀you will found a rendered `viewport.img` in your root folder.

✨the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Lrxr_NYeH4VAlV5-mAhmp8I8gjhkG-H5wsqH8AEmtUI/edit?usp=sharing) explains how it works.
